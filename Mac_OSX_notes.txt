Mac Notes:  requires the Apple provided Java 1.6 and not oracle's java 1.7/8.    The Apple version performs much better overall.

To revert follow these guides:

Apple's latest version (2015):  https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5559

-----------------------------------------------

ALSO: 

To use JSatTrak on a mac you need to have Apple's java 6 installed on your system.  If you don't follow these directions:  (note you can have both Java 6 and 7/8 installed at the same time):
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572

Then you can run the file "JSatTrak_Mac.app" to run JSatTrak properly (as long as they are in the same directory).

or you can use this command from the command line:
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java  -jar JSatTrak.jar

or for OS X 10.11:
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Commands/java  -jar JSatTrak.jar
