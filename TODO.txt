TODO
- fixes and ideas from: Christopher Suski
- in the 3D window the sun shading terminator line doesn't wrap around the earth properly when the camera is set to follow an object rather than the earth
- a viewport from the ground station to the sat
- if you can make room on the Ground station browser button should probably be one the object list window
Master Sargent:
- add launch vechile
- add missile
- Radar "fence" for ground stations
Jason Liu:
- FIX:  handle case when SGP4 Propogator fails with an error code!!!!  use this TLE past Sept 14 2009 as an example to test with -- logg error in console

Ideas for next versions: (no particular order)
- Vectors tool (make them seperate objects) axis, grids, lines, arrows (data providers)
- DATA out! - Reports and graphs and exporting of data out of program
- 3D "Earth Night Lights" mask / 1/2 sphere transparent night shell
- Add Objects (Abstract Satellites) like Moon, Sun, Panets maybe (can set view to center on them as well)?
- Satellite Orbit Lifetime Estimator
- Launch Vehicle "Simple Ascent" (or missile - Ballistic) 
- Orbit Dertermination tool
- track aircraft? (does this mean I need to rename the app?)
- swath planning
- dyanmic changing of clipping planes when in different viewing modes -- and Exponential zooming! (see my jogl 3d soloar system)
