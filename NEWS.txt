Version 3.7.5 (23 Mar 2009)

  http://forum.worldwindcentral.com/showthread.php?t=21021&highlight=sun+shading
  http://patmurris.blogspot.com/2009/04/sunlight-package-for-worldwind-java.html
  (VOTD - WWJ Broke COLOR OF 3D ORBIT TRACE - fixed - disabled 2D textures in OrbitModelRenderable and EFEFModelRenderable)
- Increased precision of GeoFunctions.GeodeticLLA
- CORRECTED error in treating SGP4 data as MOD not TEME of date! fixed (and transformation to J2000.0 - found stk prob uses 24 terms in nutation calc)
- CORRECTED error in using MOD position for LLA instead of TEME of date (corrected)
- added name.gano.astro.coordinates.J2kCoordinateConversion for better coordinate transformations! (phase out old transformations)
- now SGP4 prop matches STK very closely (~1m for ISS) and HPROP was compared as well and preformed just as well.
- added smooth changes to the 3D view options
- coordinate system selection for sat info dialog (J2k, TEME, MOD, TOD)
- REPLACED SDP4 (GPL license, see references.txt) with my own coversion of CSSI's SGP4 propagator (name.gano.astro.propogators.sgp4_cssi) (ver: 3 Nov 2008) (same one used in STK 9.0)
  Note: the above change of SGP4 props and other changes in this release make the saved files from older versions not compatible! Files should now be smaller! (why it gets promoted to v4)
- RELICENCED JSatTrak as LGPL!
- FILE FORMAT: changes to use zip compression! files are now much smaller!

Version 4.1 (10 July 2009)
- added AutoClipBasicOrbit view for dynamic clipping plane calculations (23 June)
- ECI grid, and gui options for grid and clipping planes (moved from sim properties to each 3D window)
- fixed bug (that surfaced in v4.0) for using the autorun in the coverage tool - needed to make SGP4SatData.java serializable (9 July 2009)
- Added read ephemeris from file to Custom Satellite Builder (also ability to delete "ini conditions" and add ini conditions nodes (always to top)) (10 Junly 2009)
- fixed bug where null values were no cloned properly in CustomSatellite - creating exceptions in OrbitModelRenderable/ECI rendering layer

Version 4.1.1 (21 Aug 2009)
-  Added the current look and feel to the save file / and open file
- 31 Aug - fixed addSeconds in Time to avoid max integer problems

Version 4.1.2 (26 Sep 2009)
- special apache license version released for NASA / GSFC called ILIADS (Integrated Lunar Information Architecture for Decision Support)

Version 4.1.3 (30 Mar 2010)
- now can use startup.bsh script if found in root directory on startup (run locally) to config the opening scenario (for Pat M. of WWJ)

Version 4.1.4 (27 Feb 2013)
- UPDATED TO Apache License, Version 2.0 (and started to manage src from GitHub)

Version 4.1.5 (3 Sept 2013)
- updated color chooser to work in Java 1.7.0_15 (cleaned up null pointer - substance.jar and substance-swingx.jar)
  (Updated substance jars and trident jars to version 7.2.1:  see: http://insubstantial.posterous.com/)

Version 4.1.6 (12 August 2014)
- Fixed exception that prevented SolverPanel.java from showing up when customizing the solver node of a custom satellite.

Version 4.1.7 (27 October 2014)
- Fixed bug in coverage analysis (JCoverageDialog.java).  This bug caused the analysis to fail when custom satellites existed in the scenario. 

Version 4.1.8 (16 October 2015)
- Fixed bug in java 1.7+ which caused "no-args constructor" error for swingx's org.jdesktop.swingx.tree.TreeModelSupport component.
This bug occurred when trying to open a saved file that contained a custom satellite.
This was fixed by incorporating the latest swingx source (v1.6.4) directly into the project, then editing org.jdesktop.swingx.tree.TreeModelSupport to give it a no-arg empty constructor.  Should work with files saved in 4.1.7.
- removed dependency on the swingx-0.9.4.jar (though left it in the git repository, along with the 1.6.4 compiled version)
- Updated launcher app for OS X 10.11 (as the java 1.6 path changed)
                       
Version 4.1.9 (3 March 2016)
- Added the TCCON network to the groundstations database

Version 4.1.10 (18 April 2016)
- Added a new plugin "Export_Ephemeris_1Day_All_SGP4_Sats.bsh" to export the ephemeris of the regular "SGP4" satellites.
  
Need to update to latest WWJ build - new view architecture

Version 4.1.11  (21 Feb 2017)
-  Added Iridium NEXT TLE data source file

Version 4.2.0  (16 Aug 2018)

-- 2D Map: Changed 2D image map scaling default to smooth (looks a lot better)
-- 2D Map: Added 4 new higher resolution 2D Earth image maps:
     - Earth_bathymetry_4k.jpg (source: http://madriver.me/world-map-satellite.html/satellite-image-maps-and-posters-world-map)
     - Earth_no_clouds_8k.jpg  (source: http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html )
     - Earth_with_clouds_4k.jpg  (source: http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html )
     - Earth_no_ice_or_clouds_4k.jpg  (source: http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html )

-- 2D Map: Change default night fill alpha level to 0.6f
-- 2D Map: change default background color to full black
- (beta) add ability to go full screen exclusive mode for 2D map. Added option in the windows menu (for currently selected selected 2d window).  Known issues:  problems escaping from full screen.  Escape key listener/binding doesn't seem to be working.

Version 4.2.1 (7 Nov 2018) 
- removed Shuttle from the TLE Downloader (merged from pull request from jester-xbmc).  File is no longer on the server.
