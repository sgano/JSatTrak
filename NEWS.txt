Version 3.2.1 (22 May 2008)
- unsucessful try to remove dependency on JMF
  ? view following sat (very preliminary) and 3D models?
  // bug - does CoverageAnalyzer save and open in 2d window correctly?? use dialog maybe to fix this?

Version 3.5.0 (7 August 2008)
- Added 3D models, added model view mode

- fixed 3d cone, added get/set slices and stacks parameters, improved 2d window performance by>30% (removed most drawline calls), improved land mass drawing performance

- Added app look and feel chooser to the help menu
  "C:\Documents and Settings\sgano\Desktop\JSatTrak\JSatTrak\noGUIscript.bsh"
KNOWN ISSUE:  Stored satellites reference Name this may not be unique (and many cases it isn't)! Need to store it by NORAD ID or if a custom sat some other ID

Version 3.6.1 (22 Dec 2008)
- Marvin joined team
- started in on UI improvements drag of 2D zoomed in map, mouse wheel zoom (18 Dec 2008)
- Better compression settings for JPG screenshots and movie creation (22 Dec 2008 - SEG)

Version 3.6.2 (11 Jan 2009)
- added a menu to the satellite browser - to load custom satellite TLE data, and create a custom sat

Version 3.7 (16 Jan 2009) (unreleased)
- Updates for helping oberservers (based on feed back from Dave Ortiz)
- added TLE_user directory for custom tle files that are automatically loaded (with options for category specification)
- Updates to tracking form: polar plot-print,invert colors,limit to horizon, compass points, pass prediction-rize/set Az degrees/compass points, save as csv

Version 3.7.5 (23 Mar 2009)
- Change 2D sun terminator resolution to 61 - 51 was reported by a user to cause some unwanted jumps as to which side was filled in, still has issues at times (even for higher res)
- Integrated NASA World Wind Java V0.6 - plus a few new layers (like controls), redid some swing worker routines for thread safteyness
- added substance look and feel (default Raven until Nimbus can work again),
- fixed: saving of 2D coverage windows, 2D night light effects, and main app window location and size saved.
- 3D external windows now decorated to match look and feel (if avaiblilble)
- known issue: 3D internal window doesn't work with v0.6 (nimubs Look and feel only)
- known issue: webstart cannot save movies (no fix)

Version 3.7.6 (24 Mar 2009)
- resize fix on 3D external window (in 3.7.5 they could only be made bigger) - set min size on globe panel (0,0) preferred size(50,50)

Version 3.7.7 (2 April 2009)
- added Microsfot virtual earth layer/yahoo/open maps from WWJ Experimental code

  http://patmurris.blogspot.com/2009/04/sunlight-package-for-worldwind-java.html
  (VOTD - WWJ Broke COLOR OF 3D ORBIT TRACE - fixed - disabled 2D textures in OrbitModelRenderable and EFEFModelRenderable)
- Increased precision of GeoFunctions.GeodeticLLA
- CORRECTED error in treating SGP4 data as MOD not TEME of date! fixed (and transformation to J2000.0 - found stk prob uses 24 terms in nutation calc)
- CORRECTED error in using MOD position for LLA instead of TEME of date (corrected)
- added name.gano.astro.coordinates.J2kCoordinateConversion for better coordinate transformations! (phase out old transformations)
- now SGP4 prop matches STK very closely (~1m for ISS) and HPROP was compared as well and preformed just as well.
- added smooth changes to the 3D view options
- coordinate system selection for sat info dialog (J2k, TEME, MOD, TOD)
- REPLACED SDP4 (GPL license, see references.txt) with my own coversion of CSSI's SGP4 propagator (name.gano.astro.propogators.sgp4_cssi) (ver: 3 Nov 2008) (same one used in STK 9.0)
  Note: the above change of SGP4 props and other changes in this release make the saved files from older versions not compatible! Files should now be smaller! (why it gets promoted to v4)
- RELICENCED JSatTrak as LGPL!
- FILE FORMAT: changes to use zip compression! files are now much smaller!

Version 4.1 (10 July 2009)
- added AutoClipBasicOrbit view for dynamic clipping plane calculations (23 June)
- ECI grid, and gui options for grid and clipping planes (moved from sim properties to each 3D window)
- fixed bug (that surfaced in v4.0) for using the autorun in the coverage tool - needed to make SGP4SatData.java serializable (9 July 2009)
- Added read ephemeris from file to Custom Satellite Builder (also ability to delete "ini conditions" and add ini conditions nodes (always to top)) (10 Junly 2009)
- fixed bug where null values were no cloned properly in CustomSatellite - creating exceptions in OrbitModelRenderable/ECI rendering layer

Version 4.1.1 (21 Aug 2009)
-  Added the current look and feel to the save file / and open file
- 31 Aug - fixed addSeconds in Time to avoid max integer problems

Version 4.1.2 (26 Sep 2009)
- special apache license version released for NASA / GSFC called ILIADS (Integrated Lunar Information Architecture for Decision Support)

Version 4.1.3 (30 Mar 2010)
- now can use startup.bsh script if found in root directory on startup (run locally) to config the opening scenario (for Pat M. of WWJ)

Version 4.1.4 (27 Feb 2013)
- UPDATED TO Apache License, Version 2.0 (and started to manage src from GitHub)

Version 4.1.5  
- updated color chooser to work in Java 1.7.0_15 (cleaned up null pointer - substance.jar and substance-swingx.jar)
  (Updated substance jars and trident jars to version 7.2.1:  see: http://insubstantial.posterous.com/)
                             
Need to update to latest WWJ build - new view architecture
